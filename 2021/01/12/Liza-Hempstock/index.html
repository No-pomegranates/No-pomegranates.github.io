            <p>From 《The graveyard book》 by Neil Gaiman</p>
<p><img src="/2021/01/12/Liza-Hempstock/1.jpeg" alt="1"> </p>
<p>The ONE most impressive character from this book. A young girl arbitrarily drowned to death due to groundless accusations of her witchcraft, and buried together with robbers and thieves around that area. Even in the after life where she had become a ghost for an eternity, she was still despised and shunned. </p>
<p>As Nobody grew up, he acquainted this young girl who had been trapped in solitude for 500 years. Time didn’t wash away her gaiety, nor her ability to love, while Nobody provided her with more. </p>
<p>Nobody soon learnt that Liza died without a proper tombstone buried with her. He, as a living person still, tried to get a tombstone for her. After some toilsome adventure and the help of Liza herself, Nobody escaped trouble and brought back the tombstone. </p>
<p>Because of this, Nobody was scolded by his parents. As for Liza, this tombstone signified a beautiful memory, the most touching and satisfactory of everything she experienced in her long life. </p>
<p>Liza became Nobody’s close friend, unsurprisingly. </p>
<p>Liza had personalities that many readers will easily picture out. She was floppy, outgoing, and genuine. She’s not pretty, but her smile added some charisma to her being. </p>
<p>500 years of solitude took away her ability to feel bad about her situation, yet Nobody’s appearance reignited the youthful girl who longed for happiness and love. </p>
<p>Nobody was still alive, only that he could see and talk to ghosts. </p>
<p>This meant that Nobody would one day leave her, and begin his life. Only after that might he return. </p>
<p>Liza felt torn up. </p>
<p>Her love for Nobody was mixed. She needed him. She loved him. She still wanted Nobody to experience the ups and downs of life before really reuniting with her. She wanted him to be happy, and make up for her own loss. Her inability to do anything to alleviate this opposition of her feelings made her grumpy. She started to shun Nobody. </p>
<p>When the time for their final departure arrived, this is what she said: </p>
<p>“The dead dun’t disappoint you. They’ve had their life, done what they’ve done. We dun’t change. The living, they always disappoint you, dun’t they? You meet a boy who’s all brave and noble, and he grows up to run away.” </p>
<p>Feel her grumpiness? Feel her disappointment? Feel the torture on her soul? </p>
<p>This is the last thing she said.</p>
<p>‘life is wasted on the living, Nobody Owens. For one of us is too foolish to live, and it is not I’</p>
<p>With a kiss, she left. </p>
<p>I love this character, however minor she is. </p>
<p>I felt attracted by her unconcealable solitude behind her floppy look. I love her pursuit of love behind her public display of nonchalance. </p>
<p>“ I’ll miss you. Always. “</p>
<p>Not until she said it out loud, did I realize what “always” meant to an undying ghost. </p>
<p>We like to use ‘always’ to strengthen our emotional appeal. </p>
<p>For her, this is another story. </p>
<p>“<strong>But between now and then, there was Life; and Bod walked into it with his eyes and his heart wide open</strong>“</p>
<p>Thank you, Neil Gaiman, for this wonderful and touching book. </p>
