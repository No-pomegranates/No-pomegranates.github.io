<p>“Youth” is a crock, a sucker’s game, an illusion woven from failure and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Another anime I wish I had watched earlier. </p>
<p>Apparently the name of this anime is one of the nerdiest I’ve ever heard of, so when I discovered my friends couldn’t let it go for some time, I thought they were basically crazy. </p>
<p>However, out of boredom during COVID, I started this series. </p>
<p>And, WOW. This is wayyyy too good. </p>
<p>Unlike the stereotypical ‘handsome yasashi(japanese for gentle) male lead’ and many crushes, this anime begins with a cynical narrative coming from its male lead, Hachiman Hikigaya, a rotten middle school student living his colorless life and maintaining his opposition to the rest of the community. </p>
<p>I was immediately enthrawled. </p>
<p>The graphics weren’t fancy, but they were nonetheless simplistic, colorful and comedic. The story wasn’t populated with minor characters, so every charcater had his or her unique spot in the story. </p>
<p>The ‘rotten’ male lead, Hachiman Hikigaya, despite his nonchalant looking face, turned out to be a person with kindness and strong willingness to sacrifice himself for other people. When the important friendships enter his life, he became lost. He used to maintain balance between himself and the rest of the world pretty well —- minding his own business. Now, he felt much obligation to cater to so many requests and emotional pursuits. This had torn him up. </p>
<p>The three-season anime told an extended story of how he found the best solution to his relationships with his friends, especially the romantic relationships with two female characters having completely diverge personalities. </p>
<p>He wanted to balance everything, leaving all the toil to himself. </p>
<p>However, under the guidance of his friends, he realized that sometimes he had to make the hard choices. He had to give up in order to obtain. He terminated his subtle romantic relationship with one of the girls, Yui Yuigahama ( my favorite character), and sought a better ending to the other one. Although they were still friends, this hard choice neverthess broke something deep. </p>
<p>This is an extremely sophisticated series that ought not be described in this few words. There are so many conflicts. Between friends, between family members. Anger, agony, misunderstanding, jealousy. This series run a most delicate emotional line I’ve ever watched in an anime. </p>
<p>No doubt my friends were all giving compliments. </p>
<p>The first line of the anime is : “Youth” is a crock, a sucker’s game, an illusion woven from failure and hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>I wonder what Hikigaya will think when the series end. </p>
