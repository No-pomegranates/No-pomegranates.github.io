            <p>I recently finished the two most renowned works by Garcia Marquez– <em>A hundred years of solitude</em>, and <em>El amor en los tiempos de cholera</em>. I’ll talk about them chronologically according to my reading order. </p>
<h2 id="A-hundred-years-of-solitude"><a href="#A-hundred-years-of-solitude" class="headerlink" title="A hundred years of solitude"></a>A hundred years of solitude</h2><p><img src="/2022/01/12/Two%20exemplary%20works%20by%20Garcia%20Marques/1.jpg" alt="1"></p>
<p><strong>Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.</strong> </p>
<p>A WODERFUL OPENING LINE! I ADAPTED IT FOR MY OWN USE MANY TIMES! Straightforward, yet maintaining a certain level of peculiarity. Simple, yet talking about a scene extending over, in fact, almost two decades. </p>
<p>A most controversial book. The very book that won Mr. Marquez the Nobel Prize of literature, while also the very book that has been criticized for being redundant in theme(Magical Realism) and poor in literature values. When I begin reading it, however, I couldn’t help caring about those opinions and <strong>tried my best to find out metaphors, symbolisms, awesome writing skills that, however evident and true, weren’t THAT IMPORTANT.</strong> Marques’ magnificent command of language is not in its sophisticated metaphors or symbolisms, as shown in the case of <em>the banana massacre</em> and <em>collective dementia</em>, but in his magnificent imagination and fluent storytelling skills. A same story, which could be covered by Earnest Hemmingway in 10 words(just another style, no offense), can be extended to a chapter by Mr. Marquez while not making the reader feel bored at all. This is especially fitting for this book, a book that tells about the history of a family over a hundred years, with people dying and leaving, uniting and breaking up. The stories centre around the theme of solitude(pretty straightforward XD). The solitude of love and sex, the solitude of memory, the solitude of knowledge and wisdom, the solitude of , of course, being alone on earth. The isolated town of Macondo is nonexistent, and will never exist. However, the characters come to life under Mr. Marquez’s pen strokes, and the entrance and exit of every character entangle my thoughts. Another interesting fact about this book is that the names for all characters are long and repetitive, while they also mean something in particular. Buendia, Arcadio, Jose, Ursula, Remedios, seem like typical Latino Names. However, every one of the chraracters enjoy a permutation of many of the names combined. Scholars find out that certain names symbolizes certain personalities and destinies, but I guarantee that you will lose track of them very soon. However, others believe that the sophistication itself works at cultivating a magical and confusing atmosphere, which perfectly matches the book. </p>
<h2 id="Love-in-the-time-of-Cholera"><a href="#Love-in-the-time-of-Cholera" class="headerlink" title="Love in the time of Cholera"></a>Love in the time of Cholera</h2><p><img src="/2022/01/12/Two%20exemplary%20works%20by%20Garcia%20Marques/2.jpg" alt="2"> </p>
<p><strong>It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love.</strong></p>
<p>ANOTHER TERRIFIC OPENING LINE… Marquez rocks!</p>
<p>This book, written after the publishing of the previous book, still follows the storytelling tone unique to Garcia. In addition, this time he talks about a realism story and adds many deep and provoking opinions towards life and love. </p>
<p>Florentino Ariza had a crush on Fermina Daza in his teenage years. Fermina, however, wasn’t sure what her feeling was. She was rebellious, and couldn’t distinguish her will of fighting back her father and her true affection for Ariza. Actually, she didn’t have any of the latter. </p>
<p>Urbino was born and raised and continued to be a wealthy and knowledgeable doctor. He was brave, smart and decisive. No doubt he won the affection of many contemporary girls. However, he chose Fermina. </p>
<p>Fermina said no. Because she didn’t like saying yes. But suddenly she agreed to it, as long as she wasn’t forced to eat eggplants. This marked her being at the crossroad of immaturity and maturity.</p>
<p>Ariza was torn. He made up his mind to devote his life to the great cause of waiting for Urbino to die, and then marrying Fermina. To preserve his heart only for Fermina, Ariza indulged himself in sex and the most delinquent relationships with so many different women. Widows, prostitutes, even his young cousin. This is where this book start getting magical and surreal again. But the point was made clear – Ariza was, however stupid he might seem, crystal clear of what he wanted and how he would obtain it. </p>
<p>It would only be more surprising if Urbino didn’t die from falling from a ladder while chasing a parrot. </p>
<p>It would only be more surprising if Fermina didn’t eventually agreed to Ariza’s proposal. </p>
<p>So ended the story. </p>
<p>This story was, again, a story extending beyond a great length of time. So many characters, so many different feelings to empathize with. I once again fall for Marquez’s tremendous writing skills. </p>
<p>Yet for this book, I think the deep thoughts are more important than the storytelling itself, contrary to <em>Solitude</em>. People from different ages will learn to appreciate different characters, and also learning different life philosophies from this outstanding author. </p>
